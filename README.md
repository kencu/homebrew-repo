# homebrew-repo
my personal homebrew tap

HomeBrew has most of the things I currently use. I'll add the ones it doesn't have here.

Additions:
```
xdg-utils: launcher scripts that make certain apps work better, eg gcstar
```


(Moved to homebrew's main repository):
```
pan: a popular newsnet newsreader, manages both text and binaries very well
```
